Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the 
unfashionable end of the western spiral arm
 of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun.
 Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two
 million miles is an utterly insignificant little
 blue green planet whose ape-descended life forms
 are so amazingly primitive that they still think
 digital watches are a pretty neat idea.
